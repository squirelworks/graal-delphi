{ Late531: the 5.30r3 / 5.31r4 cut.

  Both images are one executable. FileVersion is 5.303 and 5.314. The
  company string is Linux Cyberjoueurs. The engine name in the image is
  quattro_lib. Torque class names are absent, so this folder does not
  link a Torque unit and does not load the earlier 5.0.0.7 engine DLLs.

  Neither image stores an eight-character G3D, GNW or GNP literal. The
  login line still sends G3D26090, the documented token for both builds.

  Outbound lines are the classic GCHAR form: opcode plus 32, the body,
  then a newline. A newline inside the body is rejected, except the two
  internal opcodes whose length-wrap bytes were not recovered. Those two
  are recognised and not written, because a guessed header would be a
  new layout.   The outbound buffer is flushed once it is longer than
  4095 bytes. The line that crossed that length is included in the flush.

  Inbound frames are a 2-byte big-endian length. A length of 65535 is
  the long form already used by the classic framer: four more bytes, a
  big-endian length, six bytes of header in all. A length below 1 is
  the "illegal data (1)" failure and the socket is killed. The byte
  pattern for "illegal data (2)" was not recovered, so this reader does
  not raise it. Bytes inside a frame are returned as they stand. No
  cipher and no compression byte is stripped.

  ScaffoldOnly tells scripts/loopback.sh and scripts/stress.sh that this
  folder has no wire client. }
